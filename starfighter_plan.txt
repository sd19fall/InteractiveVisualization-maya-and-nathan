STARFIGHTER plan

Â© Nathan Weil 2018

In STARFIGHTER, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom
of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the 
arrow keysand shoot phasers using the spacebar. When the game begins, 
a fleet of enemy starfighters appears and moves across the and down the 
screen. If the player shoots all the enemy ships, a new fleet appears 
that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any enemy hits the 
player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a 
ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends. 

Happy Phasing!
